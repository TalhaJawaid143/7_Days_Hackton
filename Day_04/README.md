Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components:

Day 4 was all about creating dynamic frontend components to make my e-commerce platform interactive. ✨ I designed a product details page where users can view the product image, price, available colors and sizes, star ratings, a quantity selector, and an Add to Cart button.

Key Steps:

*   Worked on the frontend using "Next.js".

*   Used "JavaScript" and "TypeScript" for functionality.

*   Added Add to "Cart" functionality.

*   Styled the page using "Tailwind CSS".

*   Tested the changes with "npm run dev".
