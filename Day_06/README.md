Day 6: Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup:
Day 6 marked an exciting step in the journey as I shifted my focus towards deployment. 🚀

Before deployment, I wrapped up some final tests:

Tested the functionality of key features like product details and the Add to Cart feature.
Checked performance and responsiveness using tools like Lighthouse to ensure the platform was optimized for all devices.
Once testing was complete, I moved on to deployment:

Deploying to Vercel:

I connected my project to GitHub through Vercel for seamless integration.
Configured deployment settings to ensure smooth deployment.
Environment Variables:

Stored sensitive data, such as API keys, database credentials, and other configurations, securely in an .env file.
Made sure the environment variables were correctly set up in Vercel.
Final Testing:

After deployment, I tested the live version to ensure everything was working perfectly, from the UI to the backend.
By the end of the day, the platform was successfully deployed, ready to be shared with the world. 🌐
