Day 7: Live Deployment and Post-Launch Practices
Day 7 marked the final and most exciting step: launching the fully functional e-commerce platform into the market. ðŸš€

After successfully deploying the project on Vercel in Day 6, today was all about taking it live and planning the next steps.

Key Steps:
Launching the Platform:

Ensured the e-commerce platform was polished, fully functional, and ready for users.
Double-checked that sensitive code and environment variables were securely stored to maintain privacy and security. ðŸ”’
Post-Launch Practices:

Considered two possible paths forward:
Starting a Business:
Begin searching for potential investors to partner with, focusing on areas like marketing, inventory management, and scaling operations.

Pursuing a Career:
Update my resume to highlight this project and my skills in coding, deployment, and problem-solving.
Start practicing coding challenges and interview preparation to target roles in web development or software engineering.
This final day was a mix of reflection on the journey and planning for the future, whether itâ€™s growing a business or advancing my career in tech. ðŸŒŸ
