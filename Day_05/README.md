Day 5: Testing Errors and Handling Backend:

Day 5 was all about making sure everything on my platform was working perfectly. ðŸ›  I started by testing all the main pagesâ€”like the " ", the cart page, and othersâ€”to ensure everything was functioning smoothly. I checked if all the images were loading properly, the "UI" looked good, and the overall "user experience" felt seamless.
While testing, I ran into an issue where the product details werenâ€™t showing up after running" npm run import-data". To fix it, I installed the "data-fetch" package using:
"npm install data-fetch"

Thankfully, this solved the problem, and the product details started appearing as expected. Alhamdulillah! ðŸ™Œ

I also used "Thunder Client" to test my API endpoints and ensure that all the data was being fetched correctly. Once everything was sorted, I ran:
"npm run dev"

to go through the entire platform again, double-checking all the functionalities, UI, and UX. By the end of the day, everything was running smoothly.
