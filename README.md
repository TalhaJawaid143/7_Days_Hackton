Summary of the 7-Day Hackathon Journey:

Over the course of 7 days, I embarked on an incredible journey to create a fully functional e-commerce platform from scratch. Each day presented new challenges and opportunities to learn, innovate, and grow. Here’s a quick recap:

Day 1: Laying the Foundation
Defined the purpose of the marketplace, identified business goals, and set the vision for solving real-world problems—focusing on offering stylish, high-quality, and affordable products for a broad audience.

Day 2: Planning the Technical Structure
Created a clear technical roadmap, designing the pages and components like the home page, product listings, and cart system. Explored Sanity for managing content.

Day 3: API Integration and Migration
Migrated project data to Sanity CMS, resolved issues with schema setup, and tested APIs for a seamless data-fetching process.

Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components
Developed dynamic, responsive product pages with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Added functionality like product details, star ratings, and an “Add to Cart” system for an intuitive shopping experience.

Day 5: Testing and Error Handling
Thoroughly tested platform functionality, performance, and responsiveness. Used tools like Lighthouse and Thunder Client to validate UI, UX, and backend APIs, resolving errors like missing product data.

Day 6: Deployment Preparation
Deployed the platform on Vercel, connected it with GitHub, and securely configured environment variables for API keys and sensitive data. Conducted final checks to ensure a smooth launch.

Day 7: Live Deployment and Post-Launch Planning
Successfully launched the platform, making it live and accessible. Outlined plans for scaling the business through investor partnerships or pivoting towards personal career growth by preparing a standout resume and practicing coding for tech interviews.

This hackathon taught me how to stay adaptable, solve complex problems under pressure, and build a product that’s ready to go to market.
